#==
All differentials need to define + and *.
That happens here.

We just use @eval to define all the combinations for AbstractDifferential
subtypes, as we know the full set that might be encountered.
Thus we can avoid any ambiguities.

Notice:
    The precidence goes: (:Wirtinger, :Casted, :Zero, :DoesNotExist, :One, :Thunk, :Any)
    Thus each of the @eval loops creating definitions of + and *
    defines the combination this type with all types of  lower precidence.
    This means each eval loops is 1 item smaller than the previous.

function Base.:*(a::Wirtinger, b::Wirtinger)
    error("""
          Cannot multiply two Wirtinger objects; this error likely means a
          `WirtingerRule` was inappropriately defined somewhere. Multiplication
          of two Wirtinger objects is not defined because chain rule application
          often expands into a non-commutative operation in the Wirtinger
          calculus. To put it another way: simply given two Wirtinger objects
          and no other information, we can't know "locally" which components to
          conjugate in order to implement the chain rule. We could pick a
          convention; for example, we could define `a::Wirtinger * b::Wirtinger`
          such that we assume the chain rule application is of the form `f_a ∘ f_b`
          instead of `f_b ∘ f_a`. However, picking such a convention is likely to
          lead to silently incorrect derivatives due to commutativity assumptions
          in downstream generic code that deals with the reals. Thus, ChainRulesCore
          makes this operation an error instead.
