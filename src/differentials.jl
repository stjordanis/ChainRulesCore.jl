##### `AbstractDifferential`
#####

"""
The subtypes of `AbstractDifferential` define a custom \"algebra\" for chain
rule evaluation that attempts to factor various features like complex derivative
support, broadcast fusion, zero-elision, etc. into nicely separated parts.

All subtypes of `AbstractDifferential` implement the following operations:

`+(a, b)`: linearly combine differential `a` and differential `b`

`*(a, b)`: multiply the differential `a` by the differential `b`

`Base.conj(x)`: complex conjugate of the differential `x`

`extern(x)`: convert `x` into an appropriate non-`AbstractDifferential` type for
use outside of `ChainContext`.

Valid arguments to these operations are `T` where `T<:AbstractDifferential`, or
where `T` has proper `+` and `*` implementations.

Additionally, all subtypes of `AbstractDifferential` support `Base.iterate` and
`Base.Broadcast.broadcastable(x)`.

##### `Thunk`
#####

"""
    Thunk(()->v)
A thunk is a deferred computation.
It wraps a zero argument closure that when invoked returns a differential.
`@thunk(v)` is a macro that expands into `Thunk(()->v)`.


Calling a thunk, calls the wrapped closure.
`extern`ing thunks applies recursively, it also externs the differial that the closure returns.
If you do not want that, then simply call the thunk

```
julia> t = @thunk(@thunk(3))
Thunk(var"##7#9"())

julia> extern(t)
3

julia> t()
Thunk(var"##8#10"())

julia> t()()
3
```

### When to `@thunk`?
When writing `rrule`s (and to a lesser exent `frule`s), it is important to `@thunk`
appropriately. Propagation rule's that return multiple deriviatives are able to not
do all the work of computing all of them only to have just one used.
By `@thunk`ing the work required for each, they can only be computed when needed.

#### So why not thunk everything?
`@thunk` creates a closure over the expression, which is basically a struct with a
field for each variable used in the expression (closed over), and call overloaded.
If this would be equal or more work than actually evaluating the expression then don't do
it. An example would be if the expression itself is just wrapping something in a struct.
Such as `Adjoint(x)` or `Diagonal(x)`. Or if the expression is a constant, or is
itself a `Thunk`.
If you got the expression from another `rrule` (or `frule`), you don't need to
`@thunk` it since it will have been thunked if required, by the defining rule.
